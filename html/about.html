                             <!-- *** NOTE FOR TA ***-->
                    <!--ThaNks for Viewing My website! I just wanted to explain my formating since it varies 
                    from the rubrik.
                    -Rubric has the ordered list on the about me page. I have my ordered list on my home page!
                    - Rubric has the contact info on about me page as well, but I want people to see my contact info right
                        get into my page! I put my phone number, emails, and social medias on my home page.
                    - Rubric says there must be 2 anchors on my Webiste. I added a "Bakc to top" anchor on every page.
                    - Rubric asks for Resume to include eperience, skills, an Education. I have my education in about me page. I put
                        my skills and Experience on my "Experience Page" I did this becasue frankly, my education does not coorealte with 
                        my experience. It is more appropriate to have them on seperate pages.
                    - I beleive I got everyhting else on the Rubric!!
                                THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP AND HARD WORK!! YOU GUYS ARE AWESEOM!! -  GERSON CABRERA
                            -->
